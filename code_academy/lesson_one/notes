<body ng-app="myApp">
  ng-app = a directive: defines the scope of the application

var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
  define a new module
  contains the components of the app

app.controller('MainController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  $scope.title = 'Top Sellers in Books';}]);
  created a new controller to manage the app's data

<div class="main" ng-controller="MainController">
  ng-controller = directive: defines the scope of the controller
  properties attached to $scope can be used inside main (the controller scope)

{{ title }}
  an expression: used to display values on a page

  Workflow:
  1. create a module, use ng-app in the view to define the application scope
  2. create a controller, use ng-controller in the view to define the controller scope
  3. add data to $scope in the controller, so the values cab be displayed with expressions

{{ product.price | currency }}
  The pipe symbol (|) takes the output on the left and "pipes" it to the right.
  - known as a filter: formats the value of an expression

  ng-repeat: a directive that loops through an array & displays each element
  ng-src: sets img src to a property in the controller
  ng-click: used to run click event functions

  directives bind behavior to html elements

  - functions in the controller update the state of the data
