app.directive('appInfo', function() {
  return{
    restrict: 'E',
    scope: {
      info: '='
    },
    templateUrl: 'js/directives/appInfo.html'
  };
});

what this does:
1. create a new directive called appInfo
2. restrict:
    - specifies how directive is used in the view
    - E, used as a new html element
3. scope:
    - the attribute used to pass info into the directive
    - =, look for an attribute named info in <app-info>
      ex. <app-info info="shutterbugg"></app-info>
4. templateUrl:
    - the data is used in a template found at the templateUrl
